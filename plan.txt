So, this is basically a khata/loan app. Make logging in as convenient as possible (e.g auto login based on IP?). 

A loan can have: - a price - name - contact info (optional, for auto contacting) - starting data - timer/ending date. A link can be shared by the
loaner to the loaned guy that publicly displays the status of the loan. An 'APPROVED' loan can be created if the loaned guy is also using the app
