So, this is basically a khata/loan app. Make logging in as convenient as possible (e.g auto login based on IP?). 

A loan can have: - a price - name - contact info (optional, for auto contacting) - starting data - timer/ending date. A link can be shared by the
loaner to the loaned guy that publicly displays the status of the loan. An 'APPROVED' loan can be created if the loaned guy is also using the app

So basically, you can use this app to take and give loans.

TODO: Maybe improve UI? (Done) [ ] Otherwise create FAQ page. 
Add 'approval' feature for the loan and loan proof (in createloan). (NOw WIP)

[X] Finish notifications / 'delete notif'/'mark notif as read'
[X] Introduce 'link' in notifications DB so notifs can have links. Then in the
frontend parse the link in a button
[ ] Finish 'Mark as Paid'/adding proof to the loan in SingleLoanPage and CreateLoanPage
[ ] Finish approval notification
[ ] Some UI touches
[ ] 30m FAQ page
