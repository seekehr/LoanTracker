# LoanTracker

A website built to track loans, inspired by the 'khata' system often used in South-Asian shop owners, built using React/Tailwind and Express/MySQL/Redis.

**Preview:** https://youtu.be/LUcKv93m5lY

**Lines of code:** Nearly 5700 

**Use of AI:** AI has mostly **only** been used in generating the JSX/helping with the styling of the page, or for generating boiler plate code.

**WIP:**
I have pretty major exams in like 4 days so I'll be unable to complete the WIPs right now, perhaps later if this project shows some promise. WIP features include:

- [ ] Automatically remind user who is borrowing through contact information (e.g Whatsapp, Email, and so on).
- [ ] Allow searching through a search bar for user profiles
- [ ] Allow moderation tools
- [ ] Use AI to verify identity cards
- [ ] Complete the loan approval system
